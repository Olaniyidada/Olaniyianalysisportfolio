									<h2><a href="#">Deluxe Incorporated<br />
									Expense report management process</a></h2>
									<p>Deluxe Incorporated's AS-IS expense report management process was analyzed using a swim lane flowchart. 
									The companyâ€™s expense reimbursement is manually processed by employees, and the expense report package is 
									hand-delivered to the manager for review and approval.<br />
									The process goes back and forth until it reaches the senior manager for an approval limit above $1,000, and 
									finally stops at the accounting department for compliance and reimbursement to compensate the employee's travel 
									expenses.<br />This method seems rather outdated, given that many organizations are moving towards a paperless 
									office environment. The manual recording of information is prone to human errors such as using the wrong cost center, 
									missing information, challenges of poor handwriting, and the need for printing hard copies of the expense report and 
									receipts, which requires office equipment resources. Manual rework requires time and costs, and there is no guarantee 
									that errors will be fixed the first time. There is a need for improvement, digitization, and automation of the expense 
									report management process.</p>

									<p>Petra Insurance Company is a top provider in the insurance sector, offering a wide range of products for individuals and businesses, such as life, 
									health, auto, home, and business insurance. A detailed analysis of its life insurance application process using a swim lane process mapping diagram

									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/Petra Insurance Picture.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>Petra Insurance Company, a reputable provider of personal, commercial, and specialty insurance services, identified inefficiencies in its life insurance 
									application process through a gap analysis conducted. Manual processes such as paper applications, scanning, data entry, and mailing results were found to be 
									cost-ineffective. An urgent transition to automation was proposed. A business requirements document was prepared, detailing current problems, the proposed 
									solution of deploying customer-facing website, and the impacted systems, assumptions/dependencies, and business requirements [modules] listed. By engaging the 
									process owner and automating the process, Petra Insurance will enhance cost-effectiveness and business continuity.</p>

										<h2><a href="#">Agile Scrum<br />

									</header>
									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/Agile Scrum Picture.jfif" alt="" /></a>
									<p>Agile Scrum is a framework for managing and completing complex projects. It emphasizes iterative progress through time-boxed sprints, typically lasting 1-4 weeks. 
									Scrum teams are cross-functional, including roles like the Product Owner, Scrum Master, and Development Team. The process begins with a prioritized product backlog, 
									which informs sprint planning. Daily stand-up meetings, or Scrums, ensure transparency and quick issue resolution. At the end of each sprint, a review and retrospective 
									are conducted to assess progress and improve processes. Agile Scrum promotes flexibility, continuous improvement, and close collaboration, aiming to deliver high-quality, 
									incremental product enhancements that meet user needs.</p>

										<h2><a href="#">Unilever Canteen<br />
										Ordering System [Web page]</a></h2>
									</header>
									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/Canteen Picture.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>This capstone project focuses on Unilever, a British-Dutch FMCG company. Unilever has 1,500 employees in its UK offices, served by two 
									canteens that each seat 150 people. The peak lunch hour between 12 and 1 pm causes congestion, leading to long waits for tables and food. 
									To address this, stakeholders were engaged, and an online canteen ordering system was proposed. This system allows employees to order 
									food online, have it delivered to their workstations, and pay via payroll deduction. It also enables feedback on food quality and improves 
									inventory management. The Jira software development tool will be used for webpage development.</p>
